## Land acknowledgement

We'd like to acknowledge the Indigenous lands where we are located. The UBC Vancouver campus is located on the traditional, ancestral, and unceded territory of the xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (Musqueam), səlilwətaɬ (Tsleil-Waututh), and Skwxwú7mesh-ulh Temíx̱w (Squamish) peoples.

Please take a moment to explore [native-land.ca](https://native-land.ca/maps/native-land) so that you can visualize the Indigenous territories, languages, and treaties in your area.
