Description: This intermediate-level workshop will demonstrate how to create thematic maps using QGIS, a free and open-source Geographic Information System (GIS) for analyzing, modifying, and visualizing spatial data. Additionally, participants will learn how to perform queries on spatial data and edit the attribute table.

Prior to the workshop date, please review our [Introduction to Mapmaking with QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-mapping-intro/). Additionally, if you are new to QGIS, we recommend you review our workshop on [Reference Mapping with QGIS](https://ubc-library-rc.github.io/gis-reference-mapping/) as well.
